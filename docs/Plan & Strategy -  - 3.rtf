\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Review and Correct Route-Middleware Configuration
\f0\b0 : Start by ensuring that your route definitions and the middleware logic are aligned correctly. Particularly, verify that the route paths expected by the middleware accurately match those defined in the application.\cb1 \

\f0\b0 : Inject additional logging inside the\'a0

\f0\b0 : Check if external factors, like server configuration, permissions, or resource quotas, could be impacting the middleware's ability to load modules dynamically. Ensure the application's running environment (local development, CI/CD pipeline, production server) does not introduce variable behavior complicating the issue.\cb1 \

\f0\b0 : If feasible, replicate the issue in a simplified or isolated environment where you can systematically enable/disable parts of the application. It helps in identifying if a particular module configuration, dependency, or external integration impacts the lazy loading mechanism.\cb1 \

\f0\b0\fs32 \cf2 \cb3 Of all the files in the entire code base, the files I am attaching here are by far the most likely culprit causing these inexplicable errors. I do believe that you are correct that there is an issue with the way that we have currently implemented lazy-loading. I would first like you to review what you have learned from the documentation I uploaded to your files and asked you to review earlier \'96 What is the truly best practice in terms of implementing lazy-loading, and what files does it happen, under what conditions, etc. Then I would like you to take a look at the files provided and see how they compare and contrast. Finally I would like you to give me a highly specific set of changes, with fully implemented code, that will remedy these issues, or at least push us closer towards a solution.\cb1 \
